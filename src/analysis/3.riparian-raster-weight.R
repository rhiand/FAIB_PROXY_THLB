	## Goal

	## A stream that is a fish stream or is located in a community watershed has the following riparian class:
	## (a)S1A, if the stream averages, over a one km length, either a stream width or an active flood plain width of 100 m or greater;
	## (b)S1B, if the stream width is greater than 20 m but the stream does not have a riparian class of S1A;
	## (c)S2, if the stream width is not less than 5 m but not more than 20 m;
	## (d)S3, if the stream width is not less than 1.5 m but is less than 5 m;
	## (e)S4, if the stream width is less than 1.5 m.

	## The S1-A stream was identified using the BCGW rivers layer classification of S1A. 
	## FWA The FWA rivers layer was considered S1
	## For all streams within the FWA rivers layer, an estimated length was calculated as 
	## half the estimated FEATURE_LENGTH, as this length includes both river banks, essentially 
	## twice the length of the river.

	## The estimated width was the FEATURE_AREA_SQM divided by the estimated length. 
	## Where the estimated length was over 1 KM, and the estimated width was over 100 m, the stream was assigned S1A.
	## Additional streams that extended from this selection were also called S1A, or were manually identified 
	## and checked. All others within the FWA River layer were called S1B.
